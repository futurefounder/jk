      <description>Before you skim through this article, let me make one thing clear:
I do not hate WordPress.
Why would I, there are endless possibilities, right?
Well, in my eyes, all the possibilities have led to an overloaded system.
The type of system that is slow, or stops moving.
This is the reason I do not work with WordPress.
Nope, not even for a tiny little project.
I learned how to create a website, but when it comes to handling users &amp;amp; payment, I saw this will take me a lot of time to create on my own.</description>

🙏🏽 After months of hard work and no full free weekend, I finally took 5 days off in September.
🧘🏽‍♂️ Prioritizing mental health and re-energizing is crucial, but often neglected as a founder.
🤯 There are so many stories of founders&#39; burnout, and it happens faster than one thinks.</description>

The last weeks have been quite a adventurous ride for me.
On the day I launched my January product I had a power cut in my house.
Yeah, a real one.
Didn&amp;rsquo;t charge my laptop over night - 30% battery.
No Electricity
No Wifi.
Nice.
But, I&amp;rsquo;ll get to that in a bit.

      <description>Going on a solo-adventure has many upsides.
Full flexbility.
No one to account to.
Moving quickly.
But, there are certain risks.
Imagine you are hiking on your own.
🚶🏾‍♂️
The colourful mountains are illuminated by the sun.
The wind breeze is seemingly playing music on your clothes.
🌄
You feel fully energized about going some extra miles and run up the hill and simply just do as you please.

Overview
It&amp;rsquo;s kind of strange.
I&amp;rsquo;ve read a dozen times that things do not go as expected whilst starting a business.
But now, that things really went different from my goals and plans it feels kind of weird.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Just start a service business&amp;rdquo;.
Sounds pretty easy, right?
Wrong.
Going from a product-focused to a service-based business is more challenging than I expected.
Here is why:
I do not have an established network in the field I am diving into.
I made two switches at once.
From:
Type of work: Full-time employee
Field of work: Marketing
To:
Type of work: Self-Employed
Field of work: Team Building
Although I read about making a double switch not being recommendable I just went on and did it.</description>

      <description>I get it.
You want a good product.
Yet, I have to launch early.
And fast.
Like really, really, really fast.
 &amp;ldquo;If You&amp;rsquo;re Not Embarrassed By The First Version Of Your Product, You’ve Launched Too Late&amp;rdquo;
— Reid Hoffman
 Fast means accepting imperfection.
This is why I decided to soft-launch Remote &amp;lsquo;n Active - List on a Sub-Reddit yesterday.
And talk to people from my target audience.
And send it to a couple of friends.</description>

I then got a reply from Jonathan Lee, who runs pagereview.io.
He created a pagereview feedback page for me with really valuable feedback
I must say, I think this is really cool.
If I had a team, or more people working on the product/site, I would definitely give it a shot as it makes design critique really easy.</description>

      <description>Why join a Startup School? School is boring after all.
Or is it?
Learning how to start and maintain a successful company within the boundaries of a school like system seems somewhat uncanny when you think of it.
School was not always fun.
Most of the things taught can often not be applied to the &amp;ldquo;real life&amp;rdquo;.
Sir Ken Robinson even goes so far to say that the current education culture is a &amp;ldquo;Death Valley&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Social Media is often perceived as a superficial place were egomaniacs just try to show off how cool they are.
That&amp;rsquo;s at least been my impression of some online communities.
But, it really comes down to how you approach this way of communicating online.
It really helps to view each and every person online as somebody you see at a party, event, on the street or in the supermarket.
Even out there in the real world you come across colorful individuals.</description>

I am fully aware that the topic is adaptable to an international audience, but to niche down as much as possible I am currently focussing on the German market.
But, more and more requests for an English website have come up.
&amp;ldquo;Is the website also in English?&amp;quot;

      <description>Being self-employed comes with the illusion of total freedom, green grass, warm sun, blue sky all day and everyone around you singing &amp;ldquo;Kum ba yaaah&amp;rdquo;.
Or something like that,
I guess.
:)
The general notion is:
Do as you please.
No schedule.
No boss.
Nice.
But: total flexibility can lead to chaos.
That is my take at least.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made my first experience with remote work as a marketeer in Berlin in 2015 with my agency team distributed across Germany, our main client with a team across Germany, Europe and the US.
I then also did some digital nomading in 2017 and loved it.
Especially the flexibility to choose when and where to work got me hooked.
The year 2020 has pushed the digitization around the globe and especially in Germany to an unprecedented degree.</description>

      <title>🏃🏾‍♂️ Typeform Has Left the Chat</title>

      <description>When Typeform first went live, I was absolutely thrilled.
Suddenly, polls were fun and not that annoying anymore.
The design was minimalistic, beautiful, playful, but still professional.
But unfortunately, as with so many good technical products, it simply became more and more expensive over time and/or the free functionalities were increasingly restricted.
Typeform is collecting dem cash The design and UX are still very good, but the starting price is very high at 30 € / month (&amp;ldquo;Essential&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <title>🤳🏾 Mobile First</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve read it so often, and I was really surprised, when I forgot about the mobile versions of my projects.
Even in the advertising industry we often had the discussion of starting out with the mobile version of an ad or thinking about how the creative out will play out on mobile.
Although I must say I have made the experience that consumer driven websites often indeed have a higher mobile share, but b2b oriented services or websites often have a slightly higher desktop/laptop share.</description>

      <description>Saying no is often not that easy.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I use the website &amp;ldquo;How to say no&amp;rdquo; when I politely have to deny a business request.
Copy, paste, customize a word or two.
Et voilà.
More time in your head for the essentials.</description>

      <description>Why it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand current technologies The Netflix documentary &amp;ldquo;The Social Dilemma&amp;rdquo; has impressively shown the manipulative influence of social media on our everyday life.
Thereby one thing became clear:
Not being informed can be dangerous.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t understand how certain systems, apps, and websites work, you are more prone to manipulation.
It used to be different, wasn&amp;rsquo;t it?
Technologies have become an indispensable part of our everyday life.</description>

      <description>Website builders: There are now so many like a dime a dozen.
When I asked myself how to set up this website, I thought pretty quickly:
&amp;ldquo;Definitely not with Wordpress&amp;rdquo;
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, Wordpress is a great solution in some cases.
Just not for me.
I wanted full flexibility with the least possible effort in the creation, as in the maintenance, and that&amp;rsquo;s why I ended up with Hugo.</description>

      <description>Hi there friend from the WWW ✌🏾
After almost a decade in the advertising industry, I&amp;rsquo;ve made the decision to start my own business.
Since my first experience with remote work in 2015 I am a true advocate.
I value the freedom and flexibility, but I&amp;rsquo;ve made the experience that the human level is neglected in this technical world.
I want to change that and am therefore working on RemoteNActive.</description>
