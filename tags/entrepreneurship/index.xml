      <description>Social Media is often perceived as a superficial place were egomaniacs just try to show off how cool they are.
That&amp;rsquo;s at least been my impression of some online communities.
But, it really comes down to how you approach this way of communicating online.
It really helps to view each and every person online as somebody you see at a party, event, on the street or in the supermarket.
Even out there in the real world you come across colorful individuals.</description>
