  <div class="post-content"><p>I‚Äôve spent the last months digital nomading through Mexico.</p>
<p>During my travels I learned about the indigenous people of Mexico that use a cactus for healing and ceremonial purposes.</p>
<p>The cactus is called peyote and it‚Äôs been used for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>In the past decade many people from all over the world have also started to engage in peyote ceremonies in Mexico.</p>
<p>This has led to peyote being an endangered plant.</p>
<p>Until today, people are travelling to Mexico to use peyote for personal / healing / recreational reasons.</p>
<p>My impression is that the current cycle of drug tourists using peyote is unhealthy.</p>
<p>Peyote is being used by certain groups of people for religious and spiritual reasons.</p>
<p>The ‚Äúnew&quot;, non-religious users mainly take peyote for personal benefits.</p>
<p>To raise attention to this situation I created a game.</p>
<p>The goal of the game is to inform people about peyote and the use.</p>
<p>This brings up the question:</p>
<h1 id="what-is-peyote">What is peyote?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-is-peyote">#</a></h1>
<p>Ever heard of peyote?</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;ve read the intro you know a little.</p>
<p>But, lets dive deeper.</p>
<p>Peyote is a small, spineless cactus that is found in the south-west United States and northern Mexico.</p>
<p>The plant has been used for about six thousand years by native tribes for spiritual and healing purposes.</p>
<p>The origin of Peyote is something that has been debated for decades.</p>
<p>The most accepted theory is that Native American tribes initially used the plant for religious purposes but eventually discovered its medicinal benefits.</p>
<p>The earliest record of peyote use comes from a cave painting in Tehuacan, Mexico.</p>
<h1 id="why-peyote-is-important-to-indigenous-people-from-mexico">Why peyote is important to indigenous people from Mexico<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-peyote-is-important-to-indigenous-people-from-mexico">#</a></h1>
<p>The Native American Church (NAC) has used peyote as a sacrament for spiritual enlightenment since long before European contact.</p>
<p>This practice is still followed by the NAC today.</p>
<p>Peyote is also used by many other groups in the United States and Mexico, such as Wiccans and followers of the Native American Church.</p>
<h1 id="how-i-came-up-with-the-game">How I came up with the game<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-i-came-up-with-the-game">#</a></h1>
<p>As the idea started to formulate in my head, that I want to make a game about the situation with peyote I did not know where to start.</p>
<p>I was thinking about creating a game mechanics from scratch and could already estimate that it would take me a lot of time.</p>
<p>This is when <a href="https://twitter.com/milohill">Milo</a> showed the huge collection of open source games on GitHub.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/leereilly/games">üéÆ GitHub - Games</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bobeff/open-source-games">üîì GitHub - Open Source Games</a></p>
<p>I was truly amazed and could see, that I just have to find a project that suits my requirements and used the code base as a starter.</p>
<p>This is exactly what I did to create my game.</p>
<h1 id="the-game">The Game<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-game">#</a></h1>
<p>So, here it is my game about the hallucinogenic Mexican cactus peyote that‚Äôs going extinct, you can</p>
