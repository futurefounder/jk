I’ll cover the basics in this part.\nEven if you have a basic understanding of web development I will show you an interesting way to explain this to your parents.\nLet’s dive straight in.\nThe term ‘Web Development’ is something your parents will understand if they have heard of the internet.\nYou: “Mom, it means: developing something for the web, or for the internet.”\nBut, what does it have to do with stacking something full?\nWell, it’s pretty easy.\nStack = A pile of something in this case technology.\nFull = As technology usually covers specific areas in this case it means “All” relevant technology for creating something.\nSo the translation for your parents is:\nAll relevant technology for creating something for the internet.\nDad: “What does this “All” consist of “?\nGood question, Dad.\nWhen creating something for the web you have the following different parts:\n What you can see - also called Front End  Imagine going to a restaurant the Front End would be the service personal, the tables where you sit, the menu you receive, the food you are presented etc.\nEverything you see and interact with as a guest.\n What you can not see - also called Back End  In a restaurant that would be (in many cases) the kitchen, the suppliers, the storage, the preparation of foods and goods etc.\nLike in a restaurant in tech each part is a world of its own with specific rules and technology.\nYou can specialize in one of the two, or know enough of both, that you can set things up.\nJust like a cleaner in the kitchen is a specialised “Back End” part of the restaurant and a waiter a “Front End” specialist.\nCreating things for the internet is not new, but the field of Web Development has gained popularity leading to a 10x market growth of coding bootcamps.\nWhich brings us to the next question.\nWhy is Full Stack Web Development so popular? In my opinion for 3 reasons\n  Infamous Tech-Boom\n  Glorious Work-Life Options\n  Money, money, money\n  Social Media\n  Yes, I know I said 3 reasons.\nBut hear me out.\nThe rise of social media and especially Youtube has given web development a real boost.\nEspecially the promise of rolling out of bed and working in your pyjamas, or sipping a cold-brew coffee in a bourgeois Coffee Shop in Bangkok sounds really appealing.\nvia GIPHY\n-- This combined with Influencers promising you to learn all the skills in only 6,5,4,3,2, or even 1 month has led to a real explosion of video content on Web Development.\nAs many of these Youtubers have their own courses I would argue the amount of click-baity exaggeration is pretty high.\nMany of these courses give a strong stretch to you wallet costing hundreds, or thousands of dollars.\nThis lead to one question.\nHow can I learn Full Stack Web Development for Free? It’s pretty straight forward.\nYes, you can pay up to 20k $ or more to learn Full Stack Web Development.\nBut there is a lot of free information on the internet.\nYou can find free Full Stack Web Development information here:\n Blogs \u0026 Websites Video-Trainings on Youtube, Udemy etc. Free Open Source Websites  There are two main Websites for learning Web Development for free\n Free Code Camp The Odin Project  I have done the Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design Certificate and must say it’s a great entry point.\nYou will start learning and writing little chunks of code without having to set up any kind of coding environment, or installing any special tools.\nThe Odin Project is different.\nIt takes a different approach by simulating the “real world” a bit more.\nI did the Fundamentals Course and must say it was a bit more challenging than I thought.\nHere’s why\nMy experience with The Odin Project - Fundamentals When I started out with the The Odin Project I discovered it on reddit and thought:\n“Hey I know the basics, so I don’t need the fundamentals course”.\nI was wrong.\nThe JavaScript Course was way over my head.\nEspecially, because the course expects you to work with mac, or linux terminal.\nSo I grit my teeth together and started in the fundamentals course.\nIt took me a while to setup Linux and have the whole setup going so that I could start the course.\nThis was the first major difference to Free Code Camp.\nThe next major difference was, that the course emphasizes mindset and motivation and getting involved in the community.\nI will show you which topics the course covers next.\nFull Stack Web Development Course Syllabus on The Odin Project Here are the topics covered in the Full Stack Web Development Course of The Odin Project\n Intermediate HTML and CSS  Intermediate HTML Concepts Intermediate CSS Concepts Grid   JavaScript  Intro Organizing your JavaScript Code JavaScript in the real world Asynchronous JavaScript and APIs Testing JavaScript React JS JavaScript and the Backend Finishing up with JavaScript   Advanced HTML and CSS  Animation Accessibility Responsive Design   NodeJS  Introduction to NodeJS MongoDB Express \u0026 Mongoose Authentication APIs Testing Express Final Project   Getting Hired  Preparing for Your Job Search Applying to and Interviewing for Jobs    What is the best Full Stack Web Development Course? I really can’t answer this question for you as it comes down to personal preference, budget, time, knowledge etc.\nCan I lean Web Development for Free? Yes.\nYou can learn Full Stack Web Development without paying as these success stories from The Odin Project show.\nBut, as you might be a tye of person who need a peer group, of want the pressure of having spent money on something the free route might not be for you.\nHow are you learning at the moment? I would love to know how you are learning about Web Development.\nJust tweet me  futurefounder21.\nFurther Resources Free Full Courses\n The Odin Project Free Code Camp  Free Introduction Courses\n fullstackopen Cousera Free Intro to HTML \u0026 CSS  ",

<p><strong>You</strong>: &ldquo;<em>Mom, it means: developing something for the web, or for the internet.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, what does it have to do with stacking something full?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s pretty easy.</p>
<p>Stack = A pile of something in this case technology.</p>
<p>Full = As technology usually covers specific areas in this case it means &ldquo;All&rdquo; relevant technology for creating something.</p>
<p>So the translation for your parents is:</p>
<p><strong>All relevant technology for creating something for the internet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dad</strong>: &ldquo;<em>What does this &ldquo;All&rdquo; consist of</em> &ldquo;?</p>
<p>Good question, Dad.</p>
<p>When creating something for the web you have the following different parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>What you can see - also called <strong>Front End</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine going to a restaurant the Front End would be the service personal, the tables where you sit, the menu you receive, the food you are presented etc.</p>
<p>Everything you see and interact with as a guest.</p>
<ul>
<li>What you can not see - also called <strong>Back End</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In a restaurant that would be (in many cases) the kitchen, the suppliers, the storage, the preparation of foods and goods etc.</p>
<p>Like in a restaurant in tech each part is a world of its own with specific rules and technology.</p>
<p>You can specialize in one of the two, or know enough of both, that you can set things up.</p>
<p>Just like a cleaner in the kitchen is a specialised &ldquo;Back End&rdquo; part of the restaurant and a waiter a &ldquo;Front End&rdquo; specialist.</p>
<p>Creating things for the internet is not new, but the field of Web Development has gained popularity <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/reports/2020-coding-bootcamp-market-size-study">leading to a 10x market growth of coding bootcamps.</a></p>
<p>Which brings us to the next question.</p>
<h1 id="why-is-full-stack-web-development-so-popular">Why is Full Stack Web Development so popular?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-is-full-stack-web-development-so-popular">#</a></h1>
<p>In my opinion for 3 reasons</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Infamous Tech-Boom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glorious Work-Life Options</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money, money, money</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social Media</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, I know I said 3 reasons.</p>
<p>But hear me out.</p>
<p>The rise of social media and especially Youtube has given web development a real boost.</p>
<p>Especially the promise of rolling out of bed and working in your pyjamas, or sipping a cold-brew coffee in a bourgeois Coffee Shop in Bangkok sounds really appealing.</p>

 -->
<p>This combined with Influencers promising you to learn all the skills in only 6,5,4,3,2, or even 1 month has led to a real explosion of video content on Web Development.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/0s2Ntyp/full-stack-web-developer-youtube.gif" alt="Youtube Search Web Development"  />
</p>
<p>As many of these Youtubers have their own courses I would argue the amount of click-baity exaggeration is pretty high.</p>
<p>Many of these courses give a strong stretch to you wallet costing hundreds, or thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>This lead to one question.</p>
<h1 id="how-can-i-learn-full-stack-web-development-for-free">How can I learn Full Stack Web Development for Free?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-can-i-learn-full-stack-web-development-for-free">#</a></h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty straight forward.</p>
<p>Yes, you can pay up to <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/blog/coding-bootcamp-cost-comparison-full-stack-immersives">20k $ or more to learn Full Stack Web Development</a>.</p>
<p>But there is a lot of free information on the internet.</p>
<p>You can find free Full Stack Web Development information here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blogs &amp; Websites</li>
<li>Video-Trainings on Youtube, Udemy etc.</li>
<li>Free Open Source Websites</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two main Websites for learning Web Development for free</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a></li>
<li><a href="theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I have done the Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design Certificate and must say it&rsquo;s a great entry point.</p>
<p>You will start learning and writing little chunks of code without having to set up any kind of coding environment, or installing any special tools.</p>
<p>The Odin Project is different.</p>
<p>It takes a different approach by simulating the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; a bit more.</p>
<p>I did the Fundamentals Course and must say it was a bit more challenging than I thought.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why</p>
<h1 id="my-experience-with-the-odin-project---fundamentals">My experience with The Odin Project - Fundamentals<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#my-experience-with-the-odin-project---fundamentals">#</a></h1>
<p>When I started out with the The Odin Project I discovered it on reddit and thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Hey I know the basics, so I don&rsquo;t need the fundamentals course</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>The JavaScript Course was way over my head.</p>
<p>Especially, because the course expects you to work with mac, or linux terminal.</p>
<p>So I grit my teeth together and started in the fundamentals course.</p>
<p>It took me a while to setup Linux and have the whole setup going so that I could start the course.</p>
<p>This was the first major difference to Free Code Camp.</p>
<p>The next major difference was, that the course emphasizes mindset and motivation and getting involved in the community.</p>
<p>I will show you which topics the course covers next.</p>

<p>I really can&rsquo;t answer this question for you as it comes down to personal preference, budget, time, knowledge etc.</p>
<h1 id="can-i-lean-web-development-for-free">Can I lean Web Development for Free?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#can-i-lean-web-development-for-free">#</a></h1>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You can learn Full Stack Web Development without paying as these <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/success_stories">success stories</a> from The Odin Project show.</p>
<p>But, as you might be a tye of person who need a peer group, of want the pressure of having spent money on something the free route might not be for you.</p>
