One thing I have noticed is, that the traffic of the website is more or less stable at around 100 visits/month. But, it’s still really dependent on me creating and publishing regularly.

<p>The last month was a colorful box mixed with a wide range of experiences.</p>
<p>First, I started working as a Group Fitness Trainer again. This does get tricky in addition to my consulting work when it comes to balancing my time. Second, I neglected my business project as I had to prioritize my paid work. Third, a range of private meetings and personal obligations took a toll on my productivity.</p>
<p>Overall the month went ok income-wise, but I see room for improvement for my systems.</p>
<p>Here is why I think so.</p>
<h2 id="content-production-is-not-that-hard-thats-why-its-hard">Content Production is not that hard, that&rsquo;s why it’s hard<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#content-production-is-not-that-hard-thats-why-its-hard">#</a></h2>
<p>I have a system in place when it comes to creating my content for <a href="https://www.remotenactive.com">remotenactive.com</a>. The short version is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research: Keywords, Topic</li>
<li>Content Creation: Intro, Headlines, Links, Images etc.</li>
<li>Check &amp; Publish</li>
</ul>
<p>For some reason, I often get stuck at step no. 1 and slide into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">analysis paralysis</a>.</p>
<p>The easy part is just following the system.</p>
<p>The hard part is letting go of wanting to create “the perfect post” or trying to be too creative.
I failed on my content production goal, which is why I am asking myself a new question for this month.</p>

<p>The other challenge I was and am still facing is, clocking in the coding hours.</p>
<p>As with fitness, I have to train to code and want to treat the learning process the same way.</p>
<p>This is why I want to come up with a system of training certain coding concepts, which are easy but keep my muscle and mind memory going.</p>
<h2 id="social-media--personal-brand">Social Media &amp; Personal Brand<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#social-media--personal-brand">#</a></h2>
