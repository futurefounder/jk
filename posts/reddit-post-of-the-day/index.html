<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/nzi549/freeing_yourself_from_being_a_wannapreneur_and/">Link to the post</a></p>
<p>Here is how I created the post.</p>
<h1 id="topic">Topic<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#topic">#</a></h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s not always easy to come up with topics to write about.</p>
<p>I have been experimenting with different kinds of posts on LinkedIn and noticed one of my posts had a pretty high engagement.</p>
<p>Here are the LinkedIn stats on my post about my learnings about <a href="/posts/what-i-learned-12-weeks-ycombinator/">attending the Y Combinator Free Startup School</a>.</p>

<p><em>Data per 15.06.2021</em></p>
<p>The ER was above my other postings which is why I decided to write up a long article.</p>
<h1 id="writing-process">Writing Process<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#writing-process">#</a></h1>
<p>I have a trello board for collecting ideas and bringing order into parts of my content.</p>
<p>So I added this article idea and started out with the draft.</p>
<p>I quickly noticed this can be a 1,000+ words article, which is why I split it up into small parts, just writing the headlines and small chunks.</p>
<p>After having the general outline of the article I started with the easiest part, which took a little research, but less creativity.</p>
<p>After completing this I let it rest for a day or two.</p>
<p>Then, I wrote down the &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; part, where I had to rethink my experience with YC and dig up some images.</p>
<h1 id="user-feedback">User Feedback<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#user-feedback">#</a></h1>
<p>I looked up some of my followers on LinkedIn and send them my first draft.</p>
<p>Most of them were kind enough to read through the ~2,000 words and give me feedback.</p>
<p>From the 7 people I asked for feedback, 3 replied and gave me really well-thought through feedback.</p>
<h1 id="the-post">The Post<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-post">#</a></h1>
<p>At first I thought I will just post the whole article as a LinkedIn Article and use parts as a post.</p>
<p>One of my LinkedIn connections brought up the idea of splitting up the post.</p>
<p>I thought this makes sense, as people prefer shorter posts on the LinkedIn stream.</p>
<p>Still, I wanted to test out the article and see whether is&rsquo; actually likeable.</p>
<p>Which is why I went to reddit and posted it on the subreddit r/startups with 766k followers.</p>
<p>I saw some postings about not actually acting on startup ideas so I changed the title from</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;What I learned in 12 weeks at YCombinators&rsquo; Free Startup School&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>-&gt; How it&rsquo;s published here</p>
<p>to</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Freeing yourself from being a &ldquo;Wannapreneur&rdquo; and some advice on learning about startups online at no cost&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I guess the main insight here is, adjust your angle to the audience you are speaking to.</p>
<p>The main arguments I am making in the article are the same.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only the headline, which I fitted to the target audience.</p>
<h1 id="final-thought">Final Thought<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#final-thought">#</a></h1>
<p>A questions that came up for me is:</p>
<p>Could I have utilized this post for traffic of my own website?</p>
<p>At the moment my main goal is to get a better understanding of creating valuable content.</p>
<p>So, as this post only gave my reddit account a lot of karma I am fine with actually not gaining any traffic from it.</p>

This wasn‚Äôt just any computer, it opened a world of possibilities for a young me. My journey into the digital realm began with chatting on AOL chat and later registering on eBay, driven by the need for an affordable MP3 player. This experience was more than just an online transaction, it was a dive into a new world of technology. My first significant tech venture was building a website for my Counter-Strike clan at 15. It was here, armed with HTML and a and bunch of table elements, that I began to make stuff for the web. These early experiments on that Windows 98 machine were not just a teenage pastime, they were the building blocks of what would become a lifelong interest in technology. ",

I asked them, but got no reply. Fortunately, they were benevolent enough to inform me about it and how top fix the issue.
