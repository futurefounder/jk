<p>I started <a href="https://jessekhala.com/posts/full-stack-web-development-course-free/">getting back into Web Development</a> at the end of 2021 after realizing that I enjoy understanding how modern web development works and noticing that no-code page builders overcharge for features that are sometimes just one little line of code.
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I like no-code website builders, they often save a lot of time, but they can get pricey if you just want a few extra features.</p>
<p>Especially because I had made websites with HTML, CSS and Javascript as a teenager and had a general understanding of how the web works which made me often think &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t pay an extra 5$/month for that option&rdquo;.</p>
<h1 id="scratching-my-own-itch">Scratching My Own Itch<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#scratching-my-own-itch">#</a></h1>
<p>As I needed a website for my first small company I made the decision to create it on my own and learned a lot along the way by working through the Responsive Web Design Course by <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Freecode Camp</a>. It&rsquo;s a great platform to learn in small chunks but also create some projects. In the end, I wanted to learn more and dived into <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> which has a more realistic approach toward web development, as you have to set up your development environment instead of working on the platform.</p>
<h1 id="keeping-it-up">Keeping It Up<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#keeping-it-up">#</a></h1>
<p>Working through The Odin Projects curriculum made me notice one thing about myself. I <a href="https://jessekhala.com/posts/full-stack-web-development-course-free-month-3/">do not enjoy working on projects that I see no real value to myself</a>. Yes, I can create small little projects, but when it comes to more complex issues, I need more motivation and this comes as soon as I create projects for myself, which is what I went on doing.</p>
<h1 id="having-a-mentor">Having A Mentor<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#having-a-mentor">#</a></h1>
<p>I am extremely lucky to have found a supportive <a href="https://github.com/milo-">Mentor</a> who is not only a fantastic engineer with entrepreneurial experience, but also really good at explaining complex topics in easy words. Without him, I would have not been able to start to understand what React.js is, how the modern web works and learn smart little tricks, like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_side-by-side-editing">split screens on VSCode</a>.</p>
<h1 id="ai">AI<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#ai">#</a></h1>
<p>To me, AI is to programming what Google was in the early 2000s. Before you had to get your information from online forums, books, pdfs and so on.
