<p>Full flexbility.</p>
<p>No one to account to.</p>
<p>Moving quickly.</p>
<p>But, there are certain risks.</p>

<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>But, there is a thing you did not think about.</p>
<p>Time.</p>
<p>You had so much fun running up the big, rocky mountain and were captivated by mother nature that you did not think about getting back on time.</p>
<p>And it will get dark soon.</p>
<p>This little story portraits my view on working as a solo-founder.</p>
<p>It is surely an amazing experience and a lot of fun, but I have experienced the risk of not checking in on myself.</p>
<p>Which can then lead to over-work, or simply not keeping track of how fast I am actually moving.</p>
<p>Which is why I have a network of like minded people surrounding me, which give me feedback and also act as an indirect security net.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you be back? We are want grab some take-away later&rdquo;</p>
<p>The phone-call came just on time before deciding to run up the next junction over to the other hill</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way back&rdquo;.</p>

This wasn’t just any computer, it opened a world of possibilities for a young me. My journey into the digital realm began with chatting on AOL chat and later registering on eBay, driven by the need for an affordable MP3 player. This experience was more than just an online transaction, it was a foray into a new world of technology. My first significant tech venture was building a website for my Counter-Strike clan at 15. It was here, armed with HTML and a and bunch of table elements, that I began to making stuff for the web. These early experiments on that Windows 98 machine were not just a teenage pastime, they were the building blocks of what would become a lifelong interest in technology. ",
