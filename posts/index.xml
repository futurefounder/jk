      <description>As a hobby software developer, I am always looking for ways to improve my workflow and make my job easier. Recently, I decided to try my hand at creating a Chrome extension to help me navigate LinkedIn more efficiently.
The Goal The goal of my extension was to add a new button to LinkedIn profile pages that would allow me to quickly view a person&amp;rsquo;s recent shares. I thought this would be a useful feature because it would save me from having to navigate through multiple menus and pages to see someone&amp;rsquo;s recent activity.</description>

      <description>So, I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning Web Development for several months and things are moving very, very slowly, but surely.
Before I restarted my journey of getting into learning to code I had an understanding of how the web worked and was familiar with HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript (aka Script-Kiddie).
This was a huge benefit when I started to create my first websites again in 2021.
But then came ReactJS.</description>

      <description>Have you embedded a youtube video via iframe in your Webflow site and suddenly your page speed is super slow? Especially on mobile?
Worry no more, here’s how you can fix it.
Setup Lets first look at the iframe you are embedding in Webflow
&amp;lt;iframe width=&amp;#34;768&amp;#34; height=&amp;#34;396&amp;#34; src=&amp;#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QYAwFBGb-5U&amp;#34; rel=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; enablejsapi=&amp;#34;1&amp;#34; frameborder=&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; allow=&amp;#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt; Problem The problem with this code is, that the video content of the iframe is loaded directly with the whole page.</description>

      <description>After changing systems I accidentally deleted my local files for this website.
🤯
Here&amp;rsquo;s what happened.
After about 5 years I bought myself a new laptop. I had been working with 2 systems on my old laptop Linux &amp;amp; Windows. I saved my development files for my website locally and thought they are synced with the cloud. Well, turns out they were not.
So I cleared my old system thinking I have a backup for everything.</description>

      <description>What do Gangnam Style, Justin Bieber and Nathan Apodaca have in common?
For different reasons, they all cracked the social media algorithm leading to overnight fame.
Or, in simpler words:
They went viral.
Going viral is the goal of many creators. It’s the reason countless online professionals lost their jobs and or minds and some might even argue lives. It can lead to success at the speed of light or shed (unwanted) attention on people or topics.</description>

      <description>Overview The last month was a colorful box mixed with a wide range of experiences.
First, I started working as a Group Fitness Trainer again. This does get tricky in addition to my consulting work when it comes to balancing my time. Second, I neglected my business project as I had to prioritize my paid work. Third, a range of private meetings and personal obligations took a toll on my productivity.</description>

      <description>Overview It&amp;rsquo;s strange looking back.
I started my entrepreneurial journey 1 year ago.
A lot has happended since then.
But one thing has not changed:
My willingness to continue my entrepreneurial journey.
A hard path to walk I have had a few inquires about fulltime positions, but notice that I do not resonate with them at the moment.
Being a self funded founder is by no means easy.
I am still struggling with regular income streams and have not cracked this nut yet.</description>

      <description>Overview After nomading for some months I&amp;rsquo;m back at home and needed some time to settle back in.
It&amp;rsquo;s strange how fast the hometown can become unfamiliar.
My travelling was split into two journeys which taught and showed me vastly different ways of living.
Here&amp;rsquo;s what I mean
1. Living in alignment I spent the first 3 months on the canary islands and was surrounded by nature all day. It was amazing having the opportunity to watch the sun go up and down and have the opportunity to go surfing nearly every day.</description>

Well, that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I am experiencing right now.
I kind of lost track of The Odin Project.
Here`s why:
Loosing focus After learning about JavaScript Classes &amp;amp; ES6 Modules I had a hard time grasping the concepts, but just sticked with the material.
I was just learning about Webpack, as I stumpeld upon a Job that seemed to be a perfect fit for me.</description>

      <description>I’ve spent the last months digital nomading through Mexico.
During my travels I learned about the indigenous people of Mexico that use a cactus for healing and ceremonial purposes.
The cactus is called peyote and it’s been used for hundreds of years.
In the past decade many people from all over the world have also started to engage in peyote ceremonies in Mexico.
This has led to peyote being an endangered plant.</description>

      <description>I tried a digital detox from LinkedIn for 3 months.
In this article I am reflecting on my experience.
Here&amp;rsquo;s what happened.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with:
What is a digital detox? Digital detox is a trending topic that seems everywhere these days. The term &amp;ldquo;Digital Detox&amp;rdquo; means different things to different people and as a result, it is often misunderstood. From my experience it boils down to the following:

What happened So I finished The Odin Projects Fundamentals and had fun creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors Game.
I was really surprised at level of depth of the fundamentals course.
Not only did I repeat HTML &amp;amp; CSS Basics, but I also dived into Git and already started with JavaScript.
What I really liked is, that the program puts a heavy emphasis on the psychological aspect of learning.</description>

      <description>Framework noun
/ˈfreɪm.wɝːk/
a supporting structure around which something can be built
&amp;ndash; Definition by Cambridge Dictionary
Ever since the advent of JavaScript in the mid-90’s, developers have been struggling to find a solution for creating reusable code that can be easily be implemented in different projects.

Originally, frameworks were meant to address this problem by providing developers with more control over how their applications would run.</description>

      <description>&amp;quot;Validating&amp;quot; a business idea is like trying to validate a poker hand. It just doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense.
&amp;mdash; Daniel Vassallo (@dvassallo) December 14, 2021 The concept of &amp;ldquo;validating a business idea&amp;rdquo; creates a false sense of security.
The example by Daniel Vassallo shows this in several dimensions.
In a game of poker, you can only make calculated guesses, based on probability, experience, and the attempt of analyzing your opponent.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve finally kickstarted a digital hub in November.
I&amp;rsquo;m getting into the habit of putting out content regularly, but I&amp;rsquo;ve already noticed, that I must increase the amount and speed of content production.
I&amp;rsquo;ll get into why in a second.
As I have to balance in my marketing freelance work and many other tasks as a solo-founder as sales, billing &amp;amp; finances, administration, webhosting issues, marketing, research, target audience outreach etc.</description>

Note: The review is mainly regarding my work on remotenactive.com
October taught me to let go.
I let go of the idea that I will be creating everything from the ground up.
I let go of expecting potential new business to manifest.
I let go of the fear of launching an unperfect product.
I let go of the comfort of my known surrounding.
I let go of the co-working space I was attending.</description>

      <description>Before you skim through this article, let me make one thing clear:
I do not hate WordPress.
Why would I, there are endless possibilities, right?
Well, in my eyes, all the possibilities have led to an overloaded system.
The type of system that is slow, or stops moving.
This is the reason I do not work with WordPress.
Nope, not even for a tiny little project.
I learned how to create a website, but when it comes to handling users &amp;amp; payment, I saw this will take me a lot of time to create on my own.</description>

The last weeks have been quite a adventurous ride for me.
On the day I launched my January product I had a power cut in my house.
Yeah, a real one.
Didn&amp;rsquo;t charge my laptop over night - 30% battery.
No Electricity
No Wifi.
Nice.
But, I&amp;rsquo;ll get to that in a bit.

There&amp;rsquo;s term and a whole discussion around people who only have business ideas, but never act on them:

August was the month of hard and sweaty client work.
I was really lucky and grateful to close 3 clients at the end of july.
Whereby I helped 2 clients with remote team building and one with remote workflow and documentation.</description>

      <description>Going on a solo-adventure has many upsides.
Full flexbility.
No one to account to.
Moving quickly.
But, there are certain risks.
Imagine you are hiking on your own.
🚶🏾‍♂️
The colourful mountains are illuminated by the sun.
The wind breeze is seemingly playing music on your clothes.
🌄
You feel fully energized about going some extra miles and run up the hill and simply just do as you please.
Amazing.</description>

Overview
It&amp;rsquo;s kind of strange.
I&amp;rsquo;ve read a dozen times that things do not go as expected whilst starting a business.
But now, that things really went different from my goals and plans it feels kind of weird.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Just start a service business&amp;rdquo;.
Sounds pretty easy, right?
Wrong.
Going from a product-focused to a service-based business is more challenging than I expected.
Here is why:
I do not have an established network in the field I am diving into.
I made two switches at once.
From:
Type of work: Full-time employee
Field of work: Marketing
To:
Type of work: Self-Employed
Field of work: Team Building
Although I read about making a double switch not being recommendable I just went on and did it.</description>

      <description>I get it.
You want a good product.
Yet, I have to launch early.
And fast.
Like really, really, really fast.
&amp;ldquo;If You&amp;rsquo;re Not Embarrassed By The First Version Of Your Product, You’ve Launched Too Late&amp;rdquo;
— Reid Hoffman
Fast means accepting imperfection.
This is why I decided to soft-launch Remote &amp;rsquo;n Active - List on a Sub-Reddit yesterday.
And talk to people from my target audience.
And send it to a couple of friends.</description>

I then got a reply from Jonathan Lee, who runs pagereview.io.
He created a pagereview feedback page for me with really valuable feedback

      <description>Ich habe die letzten 6 wochen in der Öffentlich gearbeitet und habe über meine bisherige Erfahrung nachgedacht.
Ich bin zu folgenden Ergebnissen gekommen:
Ich werde meine Ziele nur noch auf monatlicher, nicht wöchentlicher Basis veröffentlichen Ich werde alle weiteren Artikel auf dieser Seite auf english erstellen, Deutsch nur auf Nachfrage. Falls du etwas mal nicht verstehst, melde dich einfach bei mir Dadurch erhöhe ich meine öffentliche Produktivität und vereinfache die Workflows, da die Übersetzungen doch viel Zeit in Anspruch nehmen</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working out in public for nearly 6 weeks and have reflected on my learnings.
Going on forward I will continue with these changes:
Tracking my goals on a monthly, not weekly basis (weekly internally) Keeping my articles in english, german translation only on requests This will improve my public productivity and help me improve content creation, as certain work flows took up more time than expected (e.g. translating idioms into german or vice versa).</description>

      <description>Why join a Startup School? School is boring after all.
Or is it?
Learning how to start and maintain a successful company within the boundaries of a school like system seems somewhat uncanny when you think of it.
School was not always fun.
Most of the things taught can often not be applied to the &amp;ldquo;real life&amp;rdquo;.
Sir Ken Robinson even goes so far to say that the current education culture is a &amp;ldquo;Death Valley&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Social Media is often perceived as a superficial place were egomaniacs just try to show off how cool they are.
That&amp;rsquo;s at least been my impression of some online communities.
But, it really comes down to how you approach this way of communicating online.
It really helps to view each and every person online as somebody you see at a party, event, on the street or in the supermarket.
Even out there in the real world you come across colorful individuals.</description>

      <description>Social Media wird oft als oberflächlicher Ort wahrgenommen, an dem Egomanen nur versuchen zu zeigen, wie cool sie sind.
Das war zumindest mein Eindruck von einigen Online-Communities.
Aber es kommt wirklich darauf an, wie du diesen Kanal nutzt.
Es ist wirklich hilfreich, jede einzelne Person online als jemanden anzusehen, den du auf einer Party, Veranstaltung, auf der Straße oder im Supermarkt siehst.
Sogar da draußen in der realen Welt stößt man auf bunte Individuen.</description>

Das Setzen klarer Ziele ist entscheidend, um sicherzustellen, dass ich mich in die richtige Richtung bewege. Außerdem bin ich mir gegenüber damit stärker verantwortlich.
Dies sind nicht alle Aufgaben die anstehen, sondern die wichtigsten Dinge, auf die ich wöchentlich hinarbeite.

Nachdem ich mit einem anderen Gründer gesprochen hatte, bemerkte ich, dass meine Herangehensweise an den Vertrieb völlig falsch war. Ich passe mich jetzt darauf an, sinnvolle Online-Verbindungen aufzubauen und nicht mit der Tür ins Haus fallen und versuchen zu verkaufen.</description>

      <description>Ich habe meine Hauptzielgruppe für remotenactive.com als aus Deutschland kommende Unternehmen definiert.
Ich bin mir völlig bewusst darüber, dass das Thema international anpassbar ist, aber um mich so weit wie möglich in eine Nische zu begeben, konzentriere ich mich derzeit auf den deutschen Markt.
Es sind jedoch immer mehr Anfragen nach einer englischen Website bei mir aufgetaucht.
Also begann ich darüber nachzudenken, wie ich die Website übersetzen kann, ohne Stunden mit der Entwicklung zu verbringen.</description>

      <description>I started out by defining my main target audience for remotenactive.com as being from Germany.
I am fully aware that the topic is adaptable to an international audience, but to niche down as much as possible I am currently focussing on the German market.
But, more and more requests for an English website have come up.
&amp;ldquo;Is the website also in English?&amp;rdquo;
So I started out thinking of ways how to translate the website without spending hours.</description>

      <description>Selbständig zu sein bringt die Illusion von völliger Freiheit, grünem Gras, warmer Sonne, blauem Himmel den ganzen Tag während alle um dich herum &amp;ldquo;Kum ba yaaah&amp;rdquo; singen.
Oder so ähnlich,
denke ich.
:)
Die Annahme dabei ist:
Mach was du willst.
Kein plan.
Kein Chef.
Nice.
Aber: totale Flexibilität kann zu Chaos führen.
Das ist zumindest meine Erfahrung.
Deshalb habe ich Arbeitsstrukturen und Gewohnheiten geschaffen, die mich verantwortlich und produktiv machen.</description>

      <description>Being self-employed comes with the illusion of total freedom, green grass, warm sun, blue sky all day and everyone around you singing &amp;ldquo;Kum ba yaaah&amp;rdquo;.
Or something like that,
I guess.
:)
The general notion is:
Do as you please.
No schedule.
No boss.
Nice.
But: total flexibility can lead to chaos.
That is my take at least.
Which is why I have created working structures and habits that keep me accountable and productive.</description>

      <description>Setting clear goals is crucial to stay accountable as a founder.
I have set overall business goals, but noticed I have to get a stronger focus.
That is why I am setting weekly goals.
These are not all To Do&amp;rsquo;s but rather the most important this I am working towards on a weekly basis.

      <description>Das Setzen klarer Ziele ist entscheidend, um sich als Gründer selbst gegenüber rechenschaftspflichtig zu sein.
Ich habe allgemeine Geschäftsziele festgelegt, aber festgestellt, dass ich mich stärker fokussieren muss.
Deshalb setze ich mir wöchentliche Ziele.
Dies sind nicht alles Aufgaben die Anliegen, sondern die wichtigsten Ziele, auf die ich wöchentlich hinarbeite.

      <description>Meine erste Erfahrung mit Remote-Arbeit habe ich in meiner Marketing-Tätigkeit in Berlin in 2015 gemacht.
Mein Agentur-Team war in Deutschland verteilt, unser Hauptkunde hatte sein Team in Deutschland, Europa und der USA.
In 2017 habe ich dann auch ein wenig Erfahrung mit Digital Nomading gemacht und es geliebt.
Besonders die Flexibilität und Freiheit zu entscheiden, wann und wo ich arbeite, hat mich begeistert.
Das Jahr 2020 hat die Digitalisierung der deutschen Wirtschaft in einem noch nie dagewesenen Maße vorangetrieben.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made my first experience with remote work as a marketeer in Berlin in 2015 with my agency team distributed across Germany, our main client with a team across Germany, Europe and the US.
I then also did some digital nomading in 2017 and loved it.
Especially the flexibility to choose when and where to work got me hooked.
The year 2020 has pushed the digitization around the globe and especially in Germany to an unprecedented degree.</description>

      <description>When Typeform first went live, I was absolutely thrilled.
Suddenly, polls were fun and not that annoying anymore.
The design was minimalistic, beautiful, playful, but still professional.
But unfortunately, as with so many good technical products, it simply became more and more expensive over time and/or the free functionalities were increasingly restricted.
Typeform is collecting dem cash The design and UX are still very good, but the starting price is very high at 30 € / month (&amp;ldquo;Essential&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <description>Als Typeform neu herauskam war ich voll begeistert.
Plötzlich haben Umfragen Spaß gemacht.
Das Design war minimalistisch, schön, verspielt, aber doch professionell.
Doch leider ist es dann wie mit so vielen guten technischen Angeboten mit der Zeit einfach immer kostspieliger geworden bzw. die kostenfreien Funktionalitäten wurden immer weiter eingeschränkt.
Typeform casht ab Das Design und UX sind immer noch sehr gut, doch der Einstiegspreis ist mit 30€ / Monat (&amp;ldquo;Essential&amp;rdquo;) sehr hoch.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve read it so often, and I was really surprised, when I forgot about the mobile versions of my projects.
Even in the advertising industry we often had the discussion of starting out with the mobile version of an ad or thinking about how the creative out will play out on mobile.
Although I must say I have made the experience that consumer driven websites often indeed have a higher mobile share, but b2b oriented services or websites often have a slightly higher desktop/laptop share.</description>

      <description>Ich habe es so oft gelesen und war wirklich überrascht, als ich die mobilen Versionen meiner Projekte vergaß.
Selbst in der Werbebranche hatten wir oft die Diskussion, mit der mobilen Version einer Anzeige zu beginnen oder darüber nachzudenken, wie sich das die Kampagne auf mobilen Geräten wirkt.
Obwohl ich sagen muss, dass ich die Erfahrung gemacht habe, dass verbraucherorientierte Websites tatsächlich häufig einen höheren Anteil an Mobilgeräten aufweisen, B2B-orientierte Dienste hingegen aber häufig einen etwas höheren Anteil an Desktops / Laptops aufweisen.</description>

      <description>Nein sagen ist oft gar nicht mal so leicht.
Deswegen nutze ich die Website &amp;ldquo;How to say no&amp;rdquo;, wenn ich mal höflich eine Business-Anfrage absagen muss.
Copy, Paste, ein, zwei Wörter anpassen.
Et voilà
Wieder mehr Zeit im Kopf für das Wesentliche.</description>

Copy, paste, customize a word or two.
Et voilà.

      <description>Why it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand current technologies The Netflix documentary &amp;ldquo;The Social Dilemma&amp;rdquo; has impressively shown the manipulative influence of social media on our everyday life.
Thereby one thing became clear:
Not being informed can be dangerous.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t understand how certain systems, apps, and websites work, you are more prone to manipulation.
It used to be different, wasn&amp;rsquo;t it?
Technologies have become an indispensable part of our everyday life.</description>

      <description>Warum es wichtig ist, aktuelle Technologien zu verstehen Die Netflix Dokumentation &amp;ldquo;The Social Dilemma&amp;rdquo; hat auf Eindrucksvolle Art und Weise den manipulativen Einfluss von Social Media auf unseren Alltag gezeigt.
Dabei ist eins klar geworden:
Unwissenheit kann gefährlich werden.
Wenn du nicht verstehst, wie gewisse Systeme, Apps und Webseiten funktionieren, bist du anfälliger für Manipulation.
Dabei war es doch früher alles anders, oder?
Technologie ist aus dem aktuellen Alltag gar nicht mehr wegzudenken.</description>

      <description>Mittlerweile gibt es ja Webseiten-Baukästen wie Sand am Meer.
Als ich mir die Frage gestellt habe, wie ich diese Webseite aufziehe, habe ich mir ziemlich schnell gedacht:
&amp;ldquo;Auf keinen Fall mit Wordpress&amp;rdquo;
Verstehe mich nicht falsch, Wordpress ist in manchen Fällen eine super Lösung.
Nur eben nicht für meinen Bedarf.
Ich wollte volle Flexibilität bei einem möglichst minimalen Aufwand bei der Erstellung, wie bei der Wartung und bin daher bei Hugo gelandet.</description>

      <description>Website builders: There are now so many like a dime a dozen.
When I asked myself how to set up this website, I thought pretty quickly:
&amp;ldquo;Definitely not with Wordpress&amp;rdquo;
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, Wordpress is a great solution in some cases.
Just not for me.
I wanted full flexibility with the least possible effort in the creation, as in the maintenance, and that&amp;rsquo;s why I ended up with Hugo.</description>
