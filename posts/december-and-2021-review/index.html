<p>And also dive into some topics that are relevant to me.</p>
<h1 id="reflection-on-my-startup"><strong>Reflection on my startup</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#reflection-on-my-startup">#</a></h1>
<p>In December I did not manage to make any money with my startup.</p>
<p>I have been working heavy on SEO and creating content, in addition to doing Sales mainly via outreach on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>My impression is, my offer does not match my target audiences problems anymore.</p>
<p>When I started out during the summer of 2021 the switch to remote work and the challenges where fresh within many German companies and therefore I got into conversations easily and was able to close some deals.</p>
<p>At the end of the year several companies have worked out their own internal solutions, or they are using one of the many new <a href="https://www.remotenactive.com/virtual-team-building-retro-style-4-cool-games-for-you/">remote working tools</a> available.</p>
<p>One challenge I did not overcome, was getting a deeper understanding of the recommendations and strategies I created for the companies.</p>
<p>It was like I created a fitness workout plan, led the person to the gym and said goodbye at the door.</p>
<p>I would like to know how things are actually going on inside.</p>
<p>This takes up significant more time and money from a companies perspective.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I did not manage to overcome this obstacle.</p>
<p>Here’s how I could have done things differently</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the way in which I communicate the value delivered to the client</li>
<li>Not implementing a paid content website before at least one client has reliably agreed to signup and pay</li>
<li>Upsell or resell on existing clients</li>
<li>Find potential collaboration companies that add my offer to their existing client base</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="freelance-work"><strong>Freelance work</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#freelance-work">#</a></h1>
<p>I sustain/ed myself by taking up contracted freelance work which is working out to pay bills.</p>
<h1 id="mindset"><strong>Mindset</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#mindset">#</a></h1>
<p>I am more than happy with the path I have chosen.</p>
<p>I know being self-employed is challenging and it takes time to create a stable financial basis.</p>
<p>My freelance &amp; entrepreneur friends said it took them up to 5 years to have a good financial base.</p>
<p>I know I have to be patient, continue to work hard and have trust that things will work out somehow.</p>
<h1 id="social-media"><strong>Social Media</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#social-media">#</a></h1>
<p>For business purposes I have been using LinkedIn &amp; Twitter.</p>
<h2 id="linkedin"><strong>Linkedin</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#linkedin">#</a></h2>
<p>Since December and especially in January I have taken a break from LinkedIn.</p>
<p>I have noticed that LinkedIn is a great platform to find potential clients, but it also had a negative impact on my mindset and motivation, as the algorithm seems to push successful, happy and shiny posts.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I am happy for each and everyone that has business success.</p>
<p>But, it skews my mental reality and does not motivate me.</p>
<h2 id="twitter"><strong>Twitter</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#twitter">#</a></h2>
<p>Twitter on the other hand feels lighter and more fun, although I also tend to scroll through the feed without a goal, I do have the feeling the value I get out of the content is higher than on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Which is why I am still using Twitter as a ways of documenting my journey.</p>
<p>Especially when it comes to Web Development.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my next topic.</p>
<h2 id="web-development"><strong>Web Development</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#web-development">#</a></h2>
<p>It’s crazy when I reflect on the fact that I created my first website when I was about 15 years old.</p>
<p>It was the clan website for a Counter Strike team me and my friends started.</p>
<p>After that I created a website for a friends father who was selling houses.</p>
<p>This led me to a job helping the wife of a friends tennis trainer create the website for their tennis team in dream weaver.</p>
<p>I did not know what Dreamweaver was and just downloaded it before the meeting and showed her things on the fly.</p>
<p>Looking back the last 2 were real freelance gigs in the Web Development space.</p>
<p>I was so much interested in computers, that I wanted to study media information systems, but ended up signing up for business information systems, as I thought my father would prefer me to do “something with business” rather than ”something with media and computers”.</p>
<p>This was in 2005 way before the current tech-boom.</p>
<p>In the past year I got back into Web Development by coding my own company website and some other little projects.</p>
<p>I noticed that it’s really fun to create web related products which I why I signed up for the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin project</a> in December.</p>
<p>I’m done with the Foundations Program and am looking forward to giving a shot at the JavaScript course.</p>
<h1 id="2022-outlook"><strong>2022 Outlook</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2022-outlook">#</a></h1>
<p>I am no big fan of new years resolutions.</p>
<p>And know that I cannot create a masterful plan for 2022.</p>
<p>But one thing is clear to me:</p>
<p>I will continue the grind.</p>
<p>And continue to learn new skills.</p>
<p>And continue to work on business models.</p>
<p>And launch new products.</p>
<p>Which is why I will dedicate more time to learning to code.</p>
