<p>Besides my main business I have picked up freelance work as a group fitness trainer again.</p>
<p>I really love helping people become fitter and motivating them to succeed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a nice change of environment as I get away from sitting in from of a screen.</p>

<p>I really value both worlds and recently remembered that this is exactly how I spent many years as a teenager.</p>
<p>I used to play soccer very actively in a competitive team and loved playing video games or with my computer in my free time.</p>

<p>First off, I am generating income again, which is very good.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I am noticing how hard it is to balance my consulting work with my projects, learning development and personal time.
I stopped tracking time on my personal projects over the month of may, but have gotten back into it, as it makes me accountable on how much I am actually investing time-wise.</p>
<p>Looking at my business I am doing good on traffic, but my offers seem not to match the target audiences&rsquo; needs.</p>
