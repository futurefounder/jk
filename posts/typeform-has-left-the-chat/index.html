<p>Suddenly, polls were fun and not that annoying anymore.</p>
<p>The design was minimalistic, beautiful, playful, but still professional.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, as with so many good technical products, it simply became more and more expensive over time and/or the free functionalities were increasingly restricted.</p>

<p>The design and UX are still very good, but the starting price is very high at 30 € / month (&ldquo;Essential&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Especially since only a few extra functionalities, such as 3 logic jumps, are included.</p>
<p>If you want to use the product reasonably well, you have to take the &ldquo;Professional&rdquo; version, which costs 45 € / month (30 € / month with annual payment</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/0D9PcQ7/typeform-prices.png" alt="https://i.ibb.co/0D9PcQ7/typeform-prices.png"  />
</p>
<p>Since I am right in the middle between &ldquo;Free&rdquo; functions are not enough, &ldquo;Essential&rdquo; is too few, but &ldquo;Professional&rdquo; is too much - in terms of functionality and price - I started looking for alternatives.</p>
<h1 id="tripetto-has-joined-the-chat">Tripetto has joined the chat<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tripetto-has-joined-the-chat">#</a></h1>
<p>The market for surveys and chat bots is now very large and there are a lot of good providers such as</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://landbot.io">Landbot.io</a></li>
<li><a href="https://surveymonkey.com">SurveyMonkey</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wufoo.com/">WuFoo</a></li>
<li><a href="http://forms.google.com/">Google Forms</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://tripetto.com">Tripetto</a> is now a new fellow that really offers a lot of functionalities completely free of charge.</p>
<p>You only &ldquo;pay&rdquo; with the provider&rsquo;s branding link.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/7KSd587/tripetto.png" alt="https://i.ibb.co/7KSd587/tripetto.png"  />
</p>
<h1 id="my-first-impression">My first impression<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#my-first-impression">#</a></h1>
<p>Tripetto is anything but intuitive.</p>
<p>At the beginning I did not understand many very important functions, and it took about 15 minutes to just understand it to some extent how the tool is actually structured.</p>
<p>For a survey that I created with Typeform in about 20 minutes, it took me about 2 hours at Tripetto -incl. the search for tutorials and looking up of explanations.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m slowly getting the hang of it and think that it will only take a little longer than creating something with Typeform.</p>
<p>So, to a certain extent, you pay with a bit of your time (and a branding link), but you have a lot of functionalities and don&rsquo;t have to worry about the next charge.</p>
<p>I have to say that I&rsquo;m pretty impressed with Tripetto now, which is why it is a very good replacement for Typeform for me.</p>
