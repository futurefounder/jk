  <div class="post-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve made my first experience with remote work as a marketeer in Berlin in 2015 with my agency team distributed across Germany, our main client with a team across Germany, Europe and the US.</p>
<p>I then also did some digital nomading in 2017 and loved it.</p>
<p>Especially the flexibility to choose when and where to work got me hooked.</p>
<p>The year 2020 has pushed the digitization around the globe and especially in Germany to an unprecedented degree.</p>
<p>The German digital industry association <a href="https://www.bitkom.org/">BITKOM</a> states <a href="https://www.bitkom.org/Presse/Presseinformation/Mehr-als-10-Millionen-arbeiten-ausschliesslich-im-Homeoffice">in a study</a> from December 2020 that location-independent work is now adopted by the masses.</p>
<p>According to their information, <strong>25% of those working in the pandemic work exclusively from home</strong>.</p>
<p>Even after the pandemic, <strong>27% of companies are expected</strong> to still work partially and another <strong>8% completely from their home office</strong>.</p>
<p>The McKinsey advisory group states in a publication on ‚Äú<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/whats-next-for-remote-work-an-analysis-of-2000-tasks-800-jobs-and-nine-countries">The future of work</a>‚Äù (11/2020) that a ‚Äú<strong>hybrid model</strong>‚Äù of in person and home office will establish itself.</p>
<h1 id="the-problem"><strong>The Problem</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-problem">#</a></h1>
<p>Waking up at home, opening your laptop and sitting in Zoom-Meetings all day <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/brain-research">withouth a break is really unhealthy.</a></p>
<p>During my full time marketing job at a big institution which just switched to remote structures some months prior to the pandemic I&rsquo;ve felt this pain personally.</p>
<p>Business publications like Handelsblatt indicate <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/meinung/gastbeitraege/gastkommentar-die-zukunft-der-arbeitswelt-ist-hybrid-nicht-digital/26150974.html?ticket=ST-4386240-rlGufEiLMeKARwLJrY2g-ap5"><strong>that the rapid digitization of work has major negative sides</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The high number of <a href="https://www.haufe.de/arbeitsschutz/gesundheit-umwelt/homeoffice-was-ist-zoom-fatigue-und-was-hilft-dagegen_94_538338.html">video meetings makes employees ‚Äú<strong>tired</strong>‚Äù and <strong>exhausted</strong></a> because there is a lack of social and informal exchange.</p>
<p>It is precisely this market problem that I address with my solution.</p>
<h1 id="solution"><strong>Solution</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#solution">#</a></h1>
<p>A <strong>positive team atmosphere</strong> is essential for productivity and job satisfaction at work - especially if your team is distributed across different locations.</p>
<p><strong>That is why I created the Remote Team Boutique Service - <a href="http://remotenactive.com">RemoteNActive.com</a></strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.ibb.co/42nKr3n/remotenactive-screen.png" alt="https://i.ibb.co/42nKr3n/remotenactive-screen.png"  />
</p>
<p>I have decided to start a serviced bases business, as each and every team has a special need that I want to address individually.</p>
<p>By this I can get to know the problems on a far deeper level than if I try to create a technical solution right away.</p>
<p>The service is an evaluation of the remote teams current tools used and experience, based on that I deliver an individual <strong>Remote Team Playbook</strong> for them to use as a guide and execute on.</p>
<p>I have made the experience that it helped me to have all activities to do in one place to look up again.</p>
<p>I also got the feedback from interviews with people from my target audience that they do exactly that - create a list of things to do.</p>
<p>This is why I will create a dynamic list for the team leaders who do not have time to do it on their own.</p>
<h1 id="target-audience"><strong>Target Audience</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#target-audience">#</a></h1>
<p>My focus is on team leaders and HR/People Managers in SMBs and agencies.</p>
<p>Ideally the teams are not too small (under 10) as these teams tend to know each other well on a personal level and do not look for further connections as I&rsquo;ve gathered from my interviews.</p>
<p>Around 10 - 20 is an ideal starting point.</p>
<h1 id="market"><strong>Market</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#market">#</a></h1>
<p>The market is noisy, which is why there is a lot of opportunity.</p>
<p>There is a high number of software based solutions like games, apps and remote team events.</p>
<p>These are often catered towards big corporations (events) or focused purely on fun (games).</p>
<p>I have screened the market and gathered many remote team activities on (website discontinued)</p>

<h1 id="challenges"><strong>Challenges</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#challenges">#</a></h1>
<p>As mentioned, the remote work market is pretty noisy, therefore it&rsquo;s challenging to get on the radar of relevant business as a new, self-funded business.</p>
<p>In addition, some companies are dealing with the issues they are having on their own.</p>
<p>My take it&rsquo;s like in the sports world.</p>
<p>You can train on your own, but having a trainer always pushes you one step further.</p>
<p>Right now my biggest challenge is to get to my first 10 customers which is critical to get things going.</p>
<p>I have started my soft-launch campaign, and I am looking at the first feedback.</p>
<p>Going on from there I will start leaning stronger into marketing.</p>
