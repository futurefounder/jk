Sounds pretty easy, right?
Wrong.
Going from a product-focused to a service-based business is more challenging than I expected.
Here is why:
I do not have an established network in the field I am diving into.
I made two switches at once.
From:
Type of work: Full-time employee
Field of work: Marketing
To:
Type of work: Self-Employed
Field of work: Team Building
Although I read about making a double switch not being recommendable I just went on and did it.">

<p><em>Richard N. Bolles</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although, I must say <a href="https://www.jessekhala.com/posts/learning-ux-design-online-my-experience/">I started working on my self-employment for several months after- and before business hours besides my fulltime-job</a>, so one might argue I made one step at a time.</p>
<p>This leads me to my first learning:</p>
<h1 id="-other-peoples-experience--your-experience">ü¶ì <strong>Other peoples&rsquo; experience ‚â† Your experience</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-other-peoples-experience--your-experience">#</a></h1>
<p>Stop treating other peoples experiences as an absolute &ldquo;How to&rdquo; path.</p>
<p>A big part of the entrepreneurial scene seems to rotate around finding people who have a &ldquo;success story&rdquo;, then trying to copy them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guilty of this mindset myself.</p>
<p>I read a lot of books and listened to podcasts all day long.</p>
<p>Since I stopped reading countless business articles, books and listening to business podcasts I feel I am starting to make progress.</p>
<p>My mind is more focused on things to do relevant to my core business, as I am not constantly faced with another story from a person who has another 5 things he learned on his journey which I should implement this week.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s kind of funny that I am writing about my experience and practically telling you not to read and listen too much to other people.</p>
<p>A world full of contradictions, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>This is actually my second learning.</p>
<h1 id="-create-a-strategy-and-execute-but-be-willing-to-adjust-at-any-moment">üêà <strong>Create a strategy and execute, but be willing to adjust at any moment</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-create-a-strategy-and-execute-but-be-willing-to-adjust-at-any-moment">#</a></h1>
<p>The first months of being an entrepreneur are really important for discovering and adapting.</p>
<p>When I started out with <a href="http://remotenactive.com">remotenactive.com</a> I first thought a web-based product is the really important solution.</p>
<p>I wanted to adapt my project from <a href="https://www.jessekhala.com/projects/#-virtual-team-activities-list">Virtual Team Activities List</a> to Remote &rsquo;n Active and thought I can more or less copy &amp; paste the thing and put a price tag on it.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>After talking to potential clients and listening to the software engineer <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/">Patrick McKenzie</a> I decided to go into a service-based approach.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h8IhbR2Iqk&amp;t=410s">&ldquo;If you can possibly avoid it don‚Äôt start in SaaS‚Äù</a></p>
<p>Yeah, sorry, I&rsquo;m once again contradicting myself.</p>
<p>As I said already: stop treating other peoples experiences as an absolute &ldquo;How to&rdquo; path.</p>
<p>But why service?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it cool to have an app?</p>
<p>The service approach will give me the opportunity to understand the nuances of my clients far better, than just reading online comments, having a couple of calls every other day and then spending countless hours on developing something no one needs.</p>
<p>It took me one month to finally decide to switch, this should have been done much earlier.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because of the third learning</p>
<h1 id="-find-real-clients-with-your-actual-problem-who-are-willing-to-pay">ü¶Å <strong>Find real clients with your actual problem who are willing to pay</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-find-real-clients-with-your-actual-problem-who-are-willing-to-pay">#</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://levels.io/idea-validation/">&quot;<em>The only real validation is people paying for your product</em>&rdquo;</a></p>
<p>Serial Entrepreneur Pieter Levels</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, here&rsquo;s a catch:</p>
<p>It really does not make sense to do sales from the perspective of a big corportation.</p>
<p>The main goal of a big corporation is to make money.</p>
<p>The main goal of a startup is to find clients who pay you.</p>
<p>Make them happy and then ideally find others and reach find product market fit.</p>
<p>That is why my sales strategy does not evolve around &ldquo;hard sales&rdquo; as in trying to convince potential clients of my service.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m searching for people who have the problem and only then do I try to convince them of working with me.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a big difference.</p>
<h1 id="-concluding-thoughts">üê∂ <strong>Concluding thoughts</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#-concluding-thoughts">#</a></h1>
<p>It feels surreal to a certain degree to see some pieces finally getting together into a picture I am trying to paint since <a href="https://www.jessekhala.com/about/">many months</a>.</p>
<p>You really have to keep in mind that creating a startup is an endeavor that does not have a clear path you can step into.</p>
<p>I underestimated the importance of marketing &amp; sales and actually getting out into the field.</p>
<p>Which in a sense is my final learning from my first 3 months.</p>
<p>Be patient.</p>

My journey into the digital realm began with chatting on AOL chat and later registering on eBay, driven by the need for an affordable MP3 player.
