<p>I spent the first 3 months on the canary islands and was surrounded by nature all day.
It was amazing having the opportunity to watch the sun go up and down and have the opportunity to go surfing nearly every day.</p>
<p>It was here that I noticed being mainly in nature and surrounded by water, not tall buildings, traffic and rushing people is a true gift.</p>
