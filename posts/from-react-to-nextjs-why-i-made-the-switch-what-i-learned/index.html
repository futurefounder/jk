Originally captivated by React‚Äôs flexibility and robust community, I‚Äôve recently transitioned to Next.js.\nIn this article, I‚Äôll unpack the strategic and technical reasons behind the move, look at some advantages of Next.js, and offer insights to help you make an informed decision for your next project.\nFollowing Milo: My Shift to Next.js Explained Guided by my mentor Milo, I shifted my focus to Next.js after initially learning React. Milo recommended the switch due to Next.js‚Äôs in-built advantages like server-side rendering and automatic optimizations. These features not only boost web performance but also streamline development, making Next.js an insightful choice for developers eager to master the intricacies of the modern digital ecosystem. What he also highlighted was the interplay of Next.js and Vercel, which I now also really enjoy.\nComparing React and Next.js: SEO, Speed, and Simplicity When comparing React and Next.js, three key areas ‚Äî SEO, performance, and development experience‚Äî stand out. React is undoubtedly versatile, but to implement SEO-friendly server-side rendering, you often need to integrate third-party libraries like ‚ÄòReact-helmet‚Äô. Next.js, however, offers built-in server-side rendering and features like getStaticProps and getServerSideProps for SEO optimization, as outlined in the Next.js Documentation.\nOn the performance side, Next.js automatically optimizes images, whereas in React, you might use a package like ‚ÄòReact-image‚Äô. From a developer‚Äôs experience viewpoint, Next.js offers file-system-based routing, eliminating the need for a separate routing library and thus streamlining the development process. Each framework has its advantages, but Next.js provides more comprehensive solutions for modern web development needs which is what I value.\nScratching My Own Itch: TindasanaAI - My Journey From Yoga Mat to Code TindasanaAI was born out of my own itch as a yoga teacher and practitioner, aiming to streamline the often cumbersome process of class planning. The application employs AI to craft personalized yoga sequences in under 30 seconds, providing an interactive UI where users can specify the theme, style, and level of their class.\nBuilt using Next.js and enriched with TypeScript, Vercel, TindasanaAI attracted over 100 visitors from more than 20 countries in about a month. Though I ultimately discontinued the app due to mixed feedback, it stands as a groundbreaking fusion of yoga and tech innovation.\nFinal Thoughts: Next.js‚Äôs Role in TindasanaAI‚Äôs Journey The switch from React to Next.js was more than just a technical transition, it was a strategic move influenced by mentorship and a drive to stay abreast of modern frameworks. The experience of developing TindasanaAI and the main landing page my9friends.com further solidified this decision, showcasing Next.js‚Äôs strengths in areas like SEO, performance, and developer experience.\nWhile each technology has its merits, Next.js has proven to be particularly well-suited for dynamic, user-centric projects like TindasanaAI. As I keep riding the rollercoaster of web development, the skills and insights I‚Äôm picking up are like my roadmap for awesome adventures ahead!\nCredit Photo by Ivy Son\n",

My journey into the digital realm began with chatting on AOL chat and later registering on eBay, driven by the need for an affordable MP3 player. This experience was more than just an online transaction, it was a foray into a new world of technology. My first significant tech venture was building a website for my Counter-Strike clan at 15. It was here, armed with HTML and a and bunch of table elements, that I began to making stuff for the web. These early experiments on that Windows 98 machine were not just a teenage pastime, they were the building blocks of what would become a lifelong interest in technology. ",
